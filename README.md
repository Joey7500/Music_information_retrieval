You can see my work which was to design a solution for identifying audio signals. Out of 706 audios in database we were required to identify 50 randomly cropped parts of some audios. There were noise and other distortions added to make it harder. I succeeded with 100 % accuracy at the end. You can check whole report together with code in ipynb file.
